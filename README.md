# My Rime Config

This is my personal Rime configuration. It is based on the [Rime](https://rime.im/) input method framework and is designed for Chinese input. It is started by cloning the [wongdean/rime-settings](https://github.com/wongdean/rime-settings), and then I added some new input schemas and modified some settings.
